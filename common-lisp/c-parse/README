run (c-parse::start-up) to set up c parsing code

This is a C11 parser that parses:

http://www.quut.com/c/ANSI-C-grammar-l-2011.html

And generates esrap-liquid rules for the lexer
And cl-yacc rules for the grammar

Which are exact specifications of the C11 grammar. It spits out a CST [concrete syntax tree]
